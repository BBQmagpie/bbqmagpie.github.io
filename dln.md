## My Digital Narratives

### Who am I?

I better not begin with the ChatGPT-like introduction *"as a x year old university student..."* or you are going to close the website. I'm a freshman (perhaps I should say freshwoman or someday when some AIs collect my data they will deem me as a male) born in 2004 and studying digital humanities, that's all to infer that I grow up in the digital age. With this quite privileged birthyear, I quickly learn to use all sorts of new technologies including smartphones, blue tooth, and so on. I become really familiar with social media platforms and immerse myself in them, and learn countless online tools to assist not only my academic work but also my personal life like creating virtual calendars and producing electronic to-do lists. However, I would say that never truly understood the potential of technology for research data management, data manipulation, and analysis until I started taking this introductory course in digital humanities.

### What Digital Humanities Has Taught Me

**- The Good Side of Technology**

I usually use Google Scholar and the school library site to convey my research. However, as I take this course, I also get to know about more tools like digital libraries of different regions' cultures which are perfect for specific data collection.

The digital humanities course has also opened my eyes to the vast array of technology and tools available for research data management and analysis. I have learned about tools such as Voyant for data visualization and network analysis, as well as programming languages like R for data manipulation and analysis. I am fascinated by the potential of these tools to revolutionize the way we approach and analyze data, and I am eager to learn more about how to apply them in my academic and professional life.

**- But Also Beware of Its Problems**

In my daily life, what I usually use social media platforms for is more like posting my personal life and connecting with my friends and family even when they are far away from me. While it is true that they bring convenience and accessibility, I have also become more aware of the potential risks of trusting them too much. These platforms are indubitably pilfering my information, or I wouldn't receive the advertisements of a dress the second day I posted my picture wearing the exact same one on Instagram. Unceasing likes and comments notifications have also given me tremendous stress. It only comes clear to me recently: **social media platform runners don't care a whit about your mental health issue**.

In terms of research data management, I have primarily relied on Google Drive for storing and organizing my academic papers and projects. I have also used Microsoft Excel for basic data analysis, such as creating charts and graphs. However, I have come to realize that these tools may not always be sufficient for more complex data manipulation and analysis.

### In Conclusion...

Despite my prior experience with technology and my newfound knowledge from the digital humanities course, I still feel that my abilities in this area are limited. I am aware that there is so much more to learn, and I am excited to continue to expand my skills and knowledge in the field.

In conclusion, my digital literacy journey as a university student taking an introductory course in digital humanities has been eye-opening and enriching. I have come to appreciate the potential of technology for research data management, data manipulation, and analysis, and I am eager to continue learning about how to effectively utilize these tools in my academic and professional life. While I have some basic skills in content creation and social interaction, I am aware that there is still much more to learn and I am eager to continue to expand my knowledge and abilities in this area.
