## My Digital Narratives

### Who am I?

I better not begin with the ChatGPT-like introduction *"as a x year old university student..."* or you are going to close the website. I'm a freshman (perhaps I should say freshwoman or someday when some AIs collect my data they will deem me as a male) born in 2004 and studying digital humanities, that's all to infer that I grow up in the digital age.

With this quite privileged birthyear, I quickly learn to use all sorts of new technologies including smartphones, blue tooth, and so on. I become really familiar with social media platforms and immerse myself in them, and learn countless online tools to assist not only my academic work but also my personal life like creating virtual calendars and producing electronic to-do lists.

However, I would say that never truly understood the potential of technology for research data management, data manipulation, and analysis until I took this introductory course in digital humanities.

### What Digital Humanities Has Taught Me

**- The Good Side of Technology**

I usually use Google Scholar and the school library site to convey my research. However, as I take this course, I also get to know about more tools like digital libraries of different regions' cultures which are perfect for specific data collection. Besides making information accessible online, these digital libraries have also taken advantage of the digital platform, that all the exhibited objects have their own metadata so that they can be easily sorted and discovered.

The digital humanities course has also opened my eyes to the vast array of technology and tools available for research data management and analysis. I have learned about tools such as Voyant for data visualization and network analysis, as well as programming languages like R for data manipulation and analysis. I have also gotten to know about distance reading through this course. Through working with the notebooks on Posit Cloud, I learn how to get the general ideas of a book just by pure machine efforts. Once we set a task for the machine, like ranking all the words from a text file by frequency, it can finish such a task on thousands of books just in a few seconds. People may wonder why we are doing that. Well, after getting all the words out, we may, for example, compare in distance the word-choice styles of each author. We can also infer the differences in the focus of two books with a similar topic. In summary, I am really fascinated by the potential of these tools to revolutionize the way we approach and analyze data, and I am eager to learn more about how to apply them in my academic and professional life.

**- But Also Beware of Its Problems**

Speaking of the technologies mentioned above, they are truly useful--but not perfect. For example, the metadata of collections provided by different digital libraries may be of different forms compared to each other, which makes them not easily comparable by programs but need human efforts to sort them again. As for the distance reading, the results given by the notebook might be misleading or incorrect due to the way we use to process the books. Also, it is generally useless for materials in those languages in which words are not separated by spaces, like Chinese. It can possibly be overcome someday but definitely require more work on it.

In my daily life, what I usually use social media platforms for is more like posting my personal life and connecting with my friends and family even when they are far away from me. While it is true that they bring convenience and accessibility, I have also become more aware of the potential risks of trusting them too much. These platforms are indubitably pilfering my information, or I wouldn't receive the advertisements of a dress the second day I posted my picture wearing the exact same one on Instagram. Unceasing likes and comments notifications have also given me tremendous stress. It only comes clear to me recently: **social media platform runners don't care a whit about your mental health issue**.

In terms of research data management, I have primarily relied on Google Drive for storing and organizing my academic papers and projects. I have also used Microsoft Excel for basic data analysis, such as creating charts and graphs. However, I have come to realize that these tools may not always be sufficient for more complex data manipulation and analysis and that some tiny mistakes you make in a chart can lead to great misunderstanding. See [this article](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2017.1375989?src=) for examples and suggestions.

### In Conclusion...

Through this introductory course, I am aware that there is so much more to learn, and I am excited to continue to expand my skills and knowledge in the field. At the same time, I have also noticed more "traps" in working with new technologies and things that need to be improved.

In conclusion, my digital literacy journey as a university student taking an introductory course in digital humanities has been eye-opening and enriching. While I have some basic skills in content creation and social interaction, I am aware that there is still much more to learn and I am eager to continue to expand my knowledge and abilities in this area.
