# Does AI Know a Piece of Artwork Better Than You?

Speaking of Artificial Intelligence in the field of Art, most would probably respond negatively to its ability, stating that Art is a mix of aesthetics and emotions, which both are seemingly quite nontangible to a cold machine. While the statement sounds plausible for AI art creation, what about...AI art recognition?

For years, as an avocational art historian, distinguishing the styles of historical artworks has been a torment for me. 99% chance you will succeed in distinguishing Pablo Picasso's Surrealism artworks and Leonardo da Vinci's Renaissance art, but what about the following three ([Figure 1](https://www.wikiart.org/en/jean-baptiste-oudry/abundance-1719), [Figure 2](https://www.wikiart.org/en/benjamin-west/erasistratus-the-physician-discovers-the-love-of-antiochus-for-stratonice), [Figure 3](https://www.wikiart.org/en/annibale-carracci/venus-adonis-and-cupid-1590))? Do you know which is a [Baroque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baroque#:~:text=The%20Baroque%20(UK%3A%20%2Fb,17th%20century%20until%20the%201750s.), which is a [Rococo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rococo), and which is a [Neoclassicism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoclassicism#:~:text=Neoclassicism%20(also%20spelled%20Neo%2Dclassicism,and%20culture%20of%20classical%20antiquity.) ?

![Example 1](/images/hw3_rococo_example.jpg "Example 1-Baroque? Rococo? Neoclassicism?")
<div align="center"> Figure 1 </div>
<br/><br/>

![Example 2](/images/hw3_neo_example.jpg "Example 2-Baroque? Rococo? Neoclassicism?")
<div align="center"> Figure 2 </div>
<br/><br/>

![Example 3](/images/hw3_baroque_example.jpg "Example 3-Baroque? Rococo? Neoclassicism?")
<div align="center"> Figure 3 </div>
<br/><br/>

The answer is *Rococo-Neoclassicism-Baroque*. How was it? Did you find it hard or easy? And now, do you wonder how AI does it?

## Image Clustering 

Before plunging into AI's performance in style recognition, let's first see how it knows the contents of artworks.

This is not done by asking the AI what it sees in a piece of art, but rather to let it **cluster** a collection of artworks.

## Oops, Wrong Model
