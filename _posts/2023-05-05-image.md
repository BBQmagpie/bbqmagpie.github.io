# Does AI Know a Piece of Artwork Better Than You?

Speaking of Artificial Intelligence in the field of Art, most would probably respond negatively to its ability, stating that Art is a mix of aesthetics and emotions, which both are seemingly quite nontangible to a cold machine. While the statement sounds plausible for AI art creation, what about...AI art recognition?

For years, as an avocational art historian, distinguishing the styles of historical artworks has been a torment for me. 99% chance you will succeed in distinguishing Pablo Picasso's Surrealism artworks and Leonardo da Vinci's Renaissance art, but what about the following three? Do you know which is a [Baroque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baroque#:~:text=The%20Baroque%20(UK%3A%20%2Fb,17th%20century%20until%20the%201750s.), which is a [Rococo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rococo), and which is a [Neoclassicism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoclassicism#:~:text=Neoclassicism%20(also%20spelled%20Neo%2Dclassicism,and%20culture%20of%20classical%20antiquity.)?
