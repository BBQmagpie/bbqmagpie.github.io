# Does AI Know a Piece of Artwork Better Than You?

Speaking of Artificial Intelligence in the field of Art, most would probably respond negatively to its ability, stating that Art is a mix of aesthetics and emotions, which both are seemingly quite nontangible to a cold machine. While the statement sounds plausible for AI art creation, what about...AI art recognition?

For years, as an avocational art historian, distinguishing the styles of historical artworks has been a torment for me. 99% chance you will succeed in distinguishing Pablo Picasso's Surrealism artworks and Leonardo da Vinci's Renaissance art, but what about the following three ([Figure 1](https://www.wikiart.org/en/jean-baptiste-oudry/abundance-1719), [Figure 2](https://www.wikiart.org/en/benjamin-west/erasistratus-the-physician-discovers-the-love-of-antiochus-for-stratonice), [Figure 3](https://www.wikiart.org/en/annibale-carracci/venus-adonis-and-cupid-1590))? Do you know which is a [Baroque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baroque#:~:text=The%20Baroque%20(UK%3A%20%2Fb,17th%20century%20until%20the%201750s.)), which is a [Rococo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rococo), and which is a [Neoclassicism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoclassicism#:~:text=Neoclassicism%20(also%20spelled%20Neo%2Dclassicism,and%20culture%20of%20classical%20antiquity.))?

![Example 1](/images/hw3_rococo_example.jpg "Example 1-Baroque? Rococo? Neoclassicism?")
<div align="center"> Figure 1-Baroque? Rococo? Neoclassicism? </div>
<br/><br/>

<div align="center"> Figure 3-Baroque? Rococo? Neoclassicism? </div>
<br/><br/>

The answer is *Rococo-Neoclassicism-Baroque*. How was it? Did you find it hard or easy? And now, do you wonder how AI does it?

## Image Clustering--What's in the Image?

Before plunging into AI's performance in style recognition, let's first see how it knows the contents of artworks. This is not done by asking the AI what it sees in a piece of art, but rather to let it **cluster** a collection of artworks. According to [Arnold and Tilton's explanation](https://www.distantviewing.org/pdf/distant-viewing.pdf), clustering means compressing a large set of images using a neural network, and then putting those with similar representations closer to each other. Hence, we can also infer how the AI has possibly understood the set of images by looking at the results of clustering.

Here, I feed [32 pieces of Baroque artwork](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VzCnWqD__4y9Cl6lVzEPTkBY5NrBxExi) into [Orange](https://orangedatamining.com/blog/image-analytics/) and use "Painters" as my embedder, which is a model trained to predict the painters of the artwork. These artworks are from the following 9 painters: Adam Elsheimer, Agnolo Bronzino, Agostino Carracci, Annibale Carracci, Caravaggio, Frans Francken the Younger, Paul Bril, Peter Paul, and Sofonisba Anguissola.

The result of clustering is shown in Figure 4. This AI model has quite clearly divided up the set of images into two parts, where on the left the contents are mainly landscapes, even though some mix with a few figures, while on the right the main portions are devoted to depictions of people. We may also see a division between the bottom left corner and the top right corner, where the former contains images of lighter colors, while the latter contains those of darker colors. Although I find the second last image in the first row confusing that, while it is a still life of fruits with a bright background, it lies in the cluster of human portraits and the upper right corner of darker colors, generally, this "Painter" model has shown some understanding of the images.

## Image Classification--What's the Style?

Now let's go to the more exciting part: *how good exactly is AI in recognizing an image's style*? Again, this is not done by asking the AI what the style is of a piece of art. **Classification** is used here to test its ability in sorting images into different styles. All we need to do is to provide it with sets of images separated by folders of different styles, and the Confusion Matrix (Figure 5) will tell us if the model has predicted which folder each image belongs to correctly.

![Classification](/images/hw3_classification.png "Classification")
<div align="center"> Figure 5-Classification of Baroque, Rococo and Neoclassicism Art </div>
<br/><br/>

I feed Orange with [four folders of images](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CboQgvXojMe_5k11XkAxLGlUSTWxR7HL). While Rococo and Neoclassicism are both extensions of Baroque, the "nr" folder contains a few artworks of a mixed style of rococo and neoclassicism. Figure 5 shows that, possibly out of your expectation as it is out of my expectation, this "Painters" model has been very good at distinguishing artworks' styles. Most of its predicted styles line up with the images' actual styles. While it fails to get the three in the "nr" folder fully correct, at least they are not put into the "Baroque" folder but are classified into one of their two styles. 

## I'm Jealous, Is It Really That Good At It?

It seems that you will probably be replaced by AI in this field if you didn't classify the three examples correctly at the beginning...is it?

Don't lose your determination yet. We haven't talked about how this "Painters" model is in distinguishing the painters of artworks. Going back to the set of Baroque artworks from 9 painters I've used in clustering, this model has given a pretty bad clustering of these painters (Figure 6).

<br/><br/>

While Frans Francken the Younger's artworks have been put quite close together, Caravaggio's and Annibale Carracci's artworks have been scattered all around the place, being claimed by the "Painters" model to be similar to everyone else's paintings but their own. This is possibly because Frans Francken the Younger's artworks are somehow unique in terms of how his chosen work is usually of a big scene with small figures in it, while Caravaggio's and Annibale Carracci's artworks are mainly human portraits. It does not mean, though, that their works are not distinguishable at all. No matter how a composition or a technique was trending at a time, just like how people's hand-writings can vary from this person to another, even for two persons drawing down the exactly same scene, their drawing habits can lead to a slight difference in their final works. However, as AI merely interprets these images by deconstructing them into 2048 real values and compare numerically, further details may not be known by it...

Even the model trained specifically for distinguishing painters fails in this field, not to say if other models like "openFace", which is designed for face recognition, can do it or not. 74 images out of the collection will be skipped if you use "openFace" to embed these paintings. This tells us that the current AI's ability in this field has not yet been completely automized. We still need to manually choose the model, select the image sets, and name the folders for it. Human intelligence still plays a very important role, while the AI is only an assistant to us when we explore a large set of images in distance.

Here is a very simple example. I put my own piece of digital artwork, which certainly belongs to none of these three styles, into the "Rococo" folder. Still using the "Painters" model, it claims my artwork to be of Baroque style (Figure 7).

## In Conclusion...

The "Painters" model in Orange could probably beat a large percentage of humans in distinguishing a set of images' styles, but unlike its name, it is not that perfect in painter recognition. Like Sonja Drimmer has argued in ["How AI is hijacking art history"](https://theconversation.com/how-ai-is-hijacking-art-history-170691), we need to be more skeptical when viewing the AI's abilities. Although AI is a very inspiriting new technology, it comes with both strengths and shortcomings, and the shortcomings should be given more attention to, as it still has a long way to go. While from my analysis I infer that the current "Painters" model is distinguishing painters mainly by the contents of the artworks, I believe further improvement needs more of the voice from real art historians than just some computer scientists, so that the technology becomes a truly reasonable technology than just a guessing game playing randomly with data sets.
