# Does AI Know a Piece of Artwork Better Than You?

Speaking of Artificial Intelligence in the field of Art, most would probably respond negatively to its ability, stating that Art is a mix of aesthetics and emotions, which both are seemingly quite nontangible to a cold machine. While the statement sounds plausible for AI art creation, what about...AI art recognition?

For years, as an avocational art historian, distinguishing the styles of historical artworks has been a torment for me. 99% chance you will succeed in distinguishing Pablo Picasso's Surrealism artworks and Leonardo da Vinci's Renaissance art, but what about the following three ([Figure 1](https://www.wikiart.org/en/jean-baptiste-oudry/abundance-1719), [Figure 2](https://www.wikiart.org/en/benjamin-west/erasistratus-the-physician-discovers-the-love-of-antiochus-for-stratonice), [Figure 3](https://www.wikiart.org/en/annibale-carracci/venus-adonis-and-cupid-1590))? Do you know which is a [Baroque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baroque#:~:text=The%20Baroque%20(UK%3A%20%2Fb,17th%20century%20until%20the%201750s.)), which is a [Rococo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rococo), and which is a [Neoclassicism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoclassicism#:~:text=Neoclassicism%20(also%20spelled%20Neo%2Dclassicism,and%20culture%20of%20classical%20antiquity.))?

![Example 1](/images/hw3_rococo_example.jpg "Example 1-Baroque? Rococo? Neoclassicism?")
<div align="center"> Figure 1-Baroque? Rococo? Neoclassicism? </div>
<br/><br/>

![Example 2](/images/hw3_neo_example.jpg "Example 2-Baroque? Rococo? Neoclassicism?")
<div align="center"> Figure 2-Baroque? Rococo? Neoclassicism? </div>
<br/><br/>

![Example 3](/images/hw3_baroque_example.jpg "Example 3-Baroque? Rococo? Neoclassicism?")
<div align="center"> Figure 3-Baroque? Rococo? Neoclassicism? </div>
<br/><br/>

The answer is *Rococo-Neoclassicism-Baroque*. How was it? Did you find it hard or easy? And now, do you wonder how AI does it?

## Image Clustering 

Before plunging into AI's performance in style recognition, let's first see how it knows the contents of artworks. This is not done by asking the AI what it sees in a piece of art, but rather to let it **cluster** a collection of artworks. According to [Arnold and Tilton's explanation](https://www.distantviewing.org/pdf/distant-viewing.pdf), clustering means compressing a large set of images using a neural network, and then putting those with similar representations closer to each other. Hence, we can also infer how the AI has possibly understood the set of images by looking at the results of clustering.

Here, I feed 32 pieces of Baroque artwork into [Orange](https://orangedatamining.com/blog/image-analytics/) and use "Painters" as my embedder, which is a model trained to predict the painters of the artwork. These artworks are from the following 9 painters: Adam Elsheimer, Agnolo Bronzino, Agostino Carracci, Annibale Carracci, Caravaggio, Frans Francken the Younger, Paul Bril, Peter Paul, and Sofonisba Anguissola.

The result of clustering is shown in Figure 4. This AI model has quite clearly divided up the set of images into two parts, where on the left the contents are mainly landscapes, even though some mix with a few figures, while on the right the main portions are devoted to depictions of people. We may also see a division between the bottom left corner and the top right corner, where the former contains images of lighter colors, while the latter contains those of darker colors. Although I find the second last image in the first row confusing that, while it is a still life of fruits with a bright background, it lies in the cluster of human portraits and the upper right corner of darker colors, generally, this "Painter" model has shown some understanding of the images.

## Image Classification

Now let's go to the more exciting part: *how good exactly is AI in recognizing an image's style*? Again, this is not done by asking the AI what the style is of a piece of art. **Classification** is used here to test its ability in sorting images into different styles.
