# How to Read a Book Without Reading the Book

Wow, so you are telling me that you are really looking for a way to read a book without actually reading the book... Don't close the page yet! I know it sounds like impossible, but I'm here to provide a solution for real. 

Let me introduce you to what is called "distant reading". [Distant reading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distant_reading) "is an approach in literary studies that applies computational methods to literary data, usually derived from large digital libraries, for the purposes of literary history and theory". Basically, it is to let your computer read the text for you, but it won't be simply returning a summary of the text. There are way more tasks it can carry out, and let's explore how they work on a specific book you probably know--*The Thousand Nights and a Night*.

## Example Analysis of *The Thousand Nights and a Night*

According to Wikipedia and ChatGPT, *The Thousand Nights and a Night* is a collection of Middle Eastern and South Asian folk tales compiled in Arabic during the Islamic Golden Age. The general idea is that a young woman, Scheherazade, tells a series of stories to her husband, King Shahryar, to prevent him from executing her as he did his previous wives. These engaging tales to save her life can be of adventure, romance, comedy, and more. Albeit their differences in plots, they all teach a moral lesson.

### Word Frequency and Word Cloud

One easy yet interesting thing to do is to make a word cloud of it. We can simply do this by R as shown in Figure 1: make a list of words that appear in the corpus, count each word's frequency, exclude meaningless words like "this" (which can be skipped if we do want to investigate these stop words' frequency), sort them, and make an image. Figure 2 is the result. We obtain a clear image that includes all words showing up at least 100 times in the corpus, with those more centered and with deeper color being more frequent words.

But wait, didn't we just say that meaningless words will be excluded? What are those eye-catching pronouns "thee", "thy" and "thou" then? It seems that our stop-word list doesn't include everything.

Let's use another tool for our corpus then. By feeding the text to [Voyant Tools](https://voyant-tools.org/), another text analysis tool without the need for coding, we get Figure 3.

Apparently, Voyant Tools has a stop-word list that excludes these old-fashioned pronouns. Other than that, the two tools also have differences in whether to take words like "say" and "said" into account. However, regardless of their differences, the strange word "fn" still exists here. What is it, a character's name? Returning to the corpus, I then find out that it actually stands for the footnotes (Figures 4 & 5). While unavoidably, this corpus about Arabic culture translated into English has a lot of words to explain in the Arabic context, "fn" must appear very frequently in it. Adding that this abbreviation is reasonable not to be included in a stop-word list, we see it in the middle of both word clouds.

Besides the possible problems in the stop-word list, sometimes we also have problems in getting the words. You may wonder how hard can it be since we can separate the words by spaces; yet, that's where the problem is at. In languages like Chinese, words are not separated by spaces, and each single character can be singly as a word, or it can also pair with a number of characters around it to form a word. Trying to maintain a word cloud can then be significantly hard. [This article](https://muse.jhu.edu/pub/23/edited_volume/chapter/3144062) shows a very interesting way to do it, while for more accurate results, more creative methods are required.

### Word Trend

Besides focusing on the rankings of each word's frequency, we can also look at the trend of it throughout the whole book.

## In Conclusion...

Just like how the summary of a book from ChatGPT can also be not true, the information provided by the text analyzing tools can also be misleading due to the tools' failure in the algorithm. It is definitely the most secure if you read the text on your own (even though your understanding can also be wrong but now that's your fault). Nevertheless, distant reading is for sure an extremely convenient way for one to quickly get the general idea of a text. What's more, the words extracted from the text can also be utilized
